# b2 - Java(tm) properties as they should have been

## bracket-properties version 2.3.0

This is the new work on the 2.0 branch which has a lot of reorganization and better design. Some things which no 
longer seemed interesting are gone, and new ideas have been implemented.

Legacy project (2011-2014) from google code is now here: https://github.com/buttermilk-crypto/bracket

Version 1.3.6 is the last of that code-base. Please use 2.3.0 which is the most recent offering!
